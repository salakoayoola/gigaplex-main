# Money app for Nextcloud

Financial management app for Nextcloud. It is loosely based on the concepts of [GnuCash](http://www.gnucash.org).

Basic functionality is working but it is still in a very early stage of development. Use at your own risk.

I will happily accept (working) pull requests for bug fixes, improvements and new (useful) features.
